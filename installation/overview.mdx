<Note>
**Kisuke Connect vs CLI — which should I install?**

Most users should install **Kisuke Connect** (above). It's the desktop app with a GUI, system tray icon, and automatic updates. It runs in the background and just works.

The **CLI** is the same thing without the GUI — a headless daemon meant for servers, Docker containers, and automated/remote environments where you don't have a desktop. If you're sitting at the computer, install Kisuke Connect. If it's a headless server, use the CLI.

## Auto-updates

Kisuke Connect checks for updates automatically. You can also update manually using the same method you used to install.
