## Install Kisuke Connect

Kisuke Connect is the desktop server GUI that runs on your computer and enables secure connections from the Kisuke mobile app.

- [macOS](/installation/mac)
- [Windows](/installation/windows)
- [Linux](/installation/linux)

## Install Kisuke Connect CLI

The CLI is the headless version of Kisuke Connect — the same daemon, without the desktop GUI. Use it for servers, containers, and automated environments.

```bash
npm install -g @kisuke/cli
```

- [CLI & Docker](/installation/cli-docker)

## Install Kisuke on mobile

On iOS and Android, connection functionality is built directly into the Kisuke app. There is no separate Kisuke Connect client for mobile.

- [iOS](/installation/ios)
- [Android](/installation/android)

## Auto-updates

Kisuke Connect checks for updates automatically. You can also update manually using the same method you used to install.
