## Setting Up Kisuke Connect (Android)

To connect your Android device to your desktop, you'll need to set up Tailscale. Here's the complete flow:

### Step 1: Install Tailscale

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Tailscale">
    Open the Google Play Store and search for **"Tailscale"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    Tap **Install** to download the Tailscale app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open">
    Once installed, tap **Open** to launch Tailscale.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Started">
    On the welcome screen, tap the button to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve VPN Permission">
    Android will show a VPN connection request popup. Tap **OK** or **Allow** to grant Tailscale VPN access.

    <Note>
    This is required for Tailscale to create a secure tunnel between your devices.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Sign In

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browser Opens Automatically">
    After approving VPN permissions, Tailscale automatically opens your browser to the sign-in page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with Google">
    Tap **Sign in with Google** and complete the authentication:
    - Select your Google account
    - Confirm permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Device">
    After signing in, you'll see a "Connect device" screen. Tap **Connect** to add this device to your network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login Successful">
    You'll see a success confirmation and be redirected back to the app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Enable Notifications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Notification Permission">
    Tailscale will ask for notification permissions. Tap **Continue**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allow Notifications">
    On the system popup, tap **Allow** to enable notifications.

    <Tip>
    Notifications help you know when you're connected and alert you to any connection issues.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 5: You're Connected

You'll now see the Tailscale home screen showing:

- Your account email and connection status
- **Exit Node** option (optional, for routing traffic)
- **Search** to find devices
- **Your devices** listed with their Tailscale IP addresses

<Info>
Your device now has a Tailscale IP address (like `100.x.x.x`) that other devices on your network can use to connect to it.
