## Overview

Kisuke Connect is the networking layer that connects your mobile device to your computers and servers. Powered by [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), it creates a secure, encrypted mesh network between all your devices—no VPN configuration, no port forwarding, no firewall rules required.

Once you're authenticated, your devices just find each other automatically.

## How It Works

                    Encrypted Mesh
```

## Quick Setup Guide

Setting up Kisuke Connect takes just a few clicks. Here's the complete flow:

### Step 1: Create Your Network

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tailscale">
    Visit [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com) and click **"Start connecting devices"** or **"Get Started"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with Google">
    Click the Google sign-in button. Complete the standard Google authentication (select account, confirm permissions).

    <Note>
    You can also sign in with other providers like Microsoft, GitHub, or Apple.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    After logging in, you'll see the Tailscale dashboard. Complete the mandatory setup steps—the analytics options are optional.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Add Your Devices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Your First Device">
    From the dashboard, click to add your first device. This will prompt you to download Tailscale for your current platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install on Desktop">
    Download and install Tailscale on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Sign in with the same account you used in Step 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install on Mobile">
    Download Tailscale from the App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android). Sign in with the same account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Connection">
    Once logged in on both devices, they automatically discover each other and connect. No additional configuration needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The connection is automatic once you're logged in on both devices. They just find each other and connect securely.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Install Kisuke

With your Tailscale network ready:

1. **On mobile**: Download Kisuke from the App Store or Play Store
2. **On desktop**: Download Kisuke Connect for your platform

Kisuke uses your Tailscale network to securely connect your devices.

## Admin Console

Tailscale provides a powerful admin console to manage your devices and network.

### Accessing the Console

From the Tailscale app or website, click **"Admin Console"** to access the full management interface.

### What You Can Do

- **View all machines** — See every device on your network with status
- **Manage access** — Control which devices can connect to each other
- **View connection info** — Check IP addresses, last seen times, and connection types
- **Remove devices** — Revoke access from old or lost devices
- **Generate auth keys** — Create keys for headless server deployments

## Key Benefits

### Zero Configuration

Just sign in on both devices and they find each other automatically. Kisuke Connect handles:

- NAT traversal
- Firewall penetration
- DNS resolution
- Key exchange

### End-to-End Encryption

All traffic between your devices is encrypted using modern cryptography:

- **WireGuard-based protocol** for fast, secure tunnels
- **X25519** key exchange
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** encryption

The coordination servers never see your decrypted traffic—they only help devices find each other.

### Works Anywhere

Kisuke Connect works through:

- Home networks
- Corporate firewalls
- Mobile data (LTE/5G)
- Coffee shop WiFi
- Hotel networks
- Carrier-grade NAT

### Direct Connections When Possible

Kisuke Connect establishes direct peer-to-peer connections whenever possible:

```
Phone ◄────── Encrypted ──────► Computer
              Direct Path
```

When direct connection isn't possible (strict firewalls, carrier-grade NAT), traffic goes through relay servers while remaining end-to-end encrypted:

```
Phone ◄──── Encrypted ────► Relay ◄──── Encrypted ────► Computer
```

<Note>
Even relayed traffic is end-to-end encrypted. Relay servers cannot read your data.
</Note>

## Auth Keys for Servers

For headless server deployments where you can't use interactive login, generate auth keys from the admin console:

1. Open the **Admin Console**
2. Go to **Settings** > **Keys**
3. Generate a new auth key
4. Use it when setting up Tailscale on your server:

```bash
tailscale up --authkey=YOUR_AUTH_KEY
```

## Use Cases

### Remote Development

Access your development machine from anywhere. Run builds, execute tests, and use terminals on your powerful desktop—all from your phone on the train.

### Server Access

Connect to servers in your home lab, cloud VMs, or office machines without exposing ports to the internet. No SSH tunnels. No bastion hosts. Just connect.

### Multi-Device Workflow

Work seamlessly across devices:

- Start a build on your laptop
- Check progress from your phone
- Fix a bug from your tablet
- All connected, all the time

## How It Compares

| Feature | Kisuke Connect | Traditional VPN | SSH Tunnels |
