## Overview

Kisuke Connect is the networking layer that connects your mobile device to your computers and servers. It creates a secure, encrypted mesh network between all your devices — no VPN configuration, no port forwarding, no firewall rules required.

Once you're authenticated, your devices just find each other automatically.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Phone     │     │   Laptop    │     │   Server    │
│   Kisuke    │◄───►│   Kisuke    │◄───►│   Kisuke    │
│             │     │   Connect   │     │   Connect   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │
       └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                    Encrypted Mesh
```

## Quick Setup Guide

Setting up Kisuke Connect takes just a few clicks:

1. **Install Kisuke Connect** on your computer ([macOS](/installation/mac), [Windows](/installation/windows), or [Linux](/installation/linux))
2. **Sign in** with your account
3. **Install Kisuke** on your mobile device ([iOS](/installation/ios) or [Android](/installation/android))
4. **Sign in** with the same account — your devices automatically discover each other and connect

<Tip>
The connection is automatic once you're signed in on both devices. They just find each other and connect securely.
</Tip>

## Admin Console

Kisuke Connect includes an admin console to manage your devices and network.

### What You Can Do

- **View all machines** — See every device on your network with status
- **Manage access** — Control which devices can connect to each other
- **View connection info** — Check IP addresses, last seen times, and connection types
- **Remove devices** — Revoke access from old or lost devices
- **Generate auth keys** — Create keys for headless server deployments

## Key Benefits

### Zero Configuration

Just sign in on both devices and they find each other automatically. Kisuke Connect handles:

- NAT traversal
- Firewall penetration
- DNS resolution
- Key exchange

### End-to-End Encryption

All traffic between your devices is encrypted using modern cryptography:

- **WireGuard-based protocol** for fast, secure tunnels
- **X25519** key exchange
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** encryption

The coordination servers never see your decrypted traffic — they only help devices find each other.

### Works Anywhere

Kisuke Connect works through:

- Home networks
- Corporate firewalls
- Mobile data (LTE/5G)
- Coffee shop WiFi
- Hotel networks
- Carrier-grade NAT

### Direct Connections When Possible

Kisuke Connect establishes direct peer-to-peer connections whenever possible:

```
Phone ◄────── Encrypted ──────► Computer
              Direct Path
```

When direct connection isn't possible (strict firewalls, carrier-grade NAT), traffic goes through relay servers while remaining end-to-end encrypted:

```
Phone ◄──── Encrypted ────► Relay ◄──── Encrypted ────► Computer
```

<Note>
Even relayed traffic is end-to-end encrypted. Relay servers cannot read your data.
</Note>

## Auth Keys for Servers

For headless server deployments where you can't use interactive login, generate auth keys from the admin console:

1. Open the **Admin Console**
2. Go to **Settings** > **Keys**
3. Generate a new auth key
4. Use it when setting up Kisuke Connect on your server:

```bash
kisuke-connect up --authkey=YOUR_AUTH_KEY
```

## Use Cases

### Remote Development

Access your development machine from anywhere. Run builds, execute tests, and use terminals on your powerful desktop — all from your phone on the train.

### Server Access

Connect to servers in your home lab, cloud VMs, or office machines without exposing ports to the internet. No SSH tunnels. No bastion hosts. Just connect.

### Multi-Device Workflow

Work seamlessly across devices:

- Start a build on your laptop
- Check progress from your phone
- Fix a bug from your tablet
- All connected, all the time

## How It Compares

| Feature | Kisuke Connect | Traditional VPN | SSH Tunnels |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Zero config | Yes | No | No |
| NAT traversal | Yes | Sometimes | No |
| End-to-end encrypted | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Works on mobile | Yes | Sometimes | Awkward |
| No server required | Yes | No | No |
