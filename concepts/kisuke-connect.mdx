## Overview

Kisuke Connect is the networking layer that connects your mobile device to your computers and servers. It creates a secure, encrypted mesh network between all your devices—no VPN configuration, no port forwarding, no firewall rules required.

Think of it like Tailscale: once you're authenticated, your devices just find each other.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Phone     │     │   Laptop    │     │   Server    │
│   Kisuke    │◄───►│   Kisuke    │◄───►│   Kisuke    │
│             │     │   Connect   │     │   Connect   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │
       └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                    Encrypted Mesh
```

### The Connection Flow

1. **Download Client** — Install Kisuke on your phone and Kisuke Connect on your computer
2. **Authenticate** — Sign in with your identity provider (Claude, Google, or OpenAI)
3. **Authorize Device** — Each device gets a unique cryptographic identity bound to your account
4. **Connected** — Devices discover each other and establish direct, encrypted connections

That's it. No IP addresses to remember. No configuration files to edit. Just sign in.

## Key Benefits

### Zero Configuration

Just sign in on both devices and they find each other automatically. Kisuke Connect handles:

- NAT traversal
- Firewall penetration
- DNS resolution
- Key exchange

### End-to-End Encryption

All traffic between your devices is encrypted using modern cryptography:

- **WireGuard®-based protocol** for fast, secure tunnels
- **X25519** key exchange
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** encryption

Kisuke servers never see your decrypted traffic—they only help devices find each other.

### Works Anywhere

Kisuke Connect works through:

- Home networks
- Corporate firewalls
- Mobile data (LTE/5G)
- Coffee shop WiFi
- Hotel networks
- Carrier-grade NAT

### Direct Connections When Possible

Kisuke Connect uses modern NAT traversal techniques to establish direct peer-to-peer connections whenever possible:

```
Phone ◄────── Encrypted ──────► Computer
              Direct Path
```

When direct connection isn't possible (strict firewalls, carrier-grade NAT), traffic goes through Kisuke relay servers while remaining end-to-end encrypted:

```
Phone ◄──── Encrypted ────► Relay ◄──── Encrypted ────► Computer
```

<Note>
Even relayed traffic is end-to-end encrypted. Relay servers cannot read your data.
</Note>

## Device Management

View and manage your connected devices in the Kisuke app:

- **Devices list** - See all devices on your account
- **Connection status** - Check if devices are online
- **Connection type** - See if you're connected directly or via relay
- **Remove devices** - Revoke access to old devices

## Authentication

Kisuke Connect uses your identity provider for authentication:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Google**
- **OpenAI**

This means:

- No separate passwords to manage
- Your provider's security (2FA, SSO, etc.) protects your network
- Single sign-on across all devices
- Automatic device authorization when you sign in

### Auth Keys for Servers

For headless server deployments, generate auth keys:

1. Open Kisuke on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** > **Auth Keys**
3. Generate a new key
4. Use it when setting up Kisuke Connect on your server

```bash
kisuke-connect up --auth-key=YOUR_AUTH_KEY
```

> **USER TODO:** Insert the specific auth key flag for your version.

## Use Cases

### Remote Development

Access your development machine from anywhere. Run builds, execute tests, and use terminals on your powerful desktop—all from your phone on the train.

### Server Access

Connect to servers in your home lab, cloud VMs, or office machines without exposing ports to the internet. No SSH tunnels. No bastion hosts. Just connect.

### Multi-Device Workflow

Work seamlessly across devices:

- Start a build on your laptop
- Check progress from your phone
- Fix a bug from your tablet
- All connected, all the time

### File Transfer

Securely move files between devices without cloud storage middlemen. Your files travel directly between your devices.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Kisuke Connect | Traditional VPN | SSH Tunnels |
