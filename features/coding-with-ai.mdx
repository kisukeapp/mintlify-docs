## Features

### Code Context

When you're in a Space, the AI has access to:

- Your project files
- Recent terminal output
- Previous conversation history

This helps Claude give relevant, contextual answers specific to your codebase.

### Code Generation

Ask Claude to write code:

```
"Write a Python function to parse CSV files"
"Create a React component for a login form"
"Generate SQL to find duplicate records"
```

### Debugging Help

Share errors and get solutions:

```
"Why am I getting this error: [paste error]"
"My API call returns 403, what could be wrong?"
"This function returns undefined, help me debug"
```

### Code Explanation

Understand unfamiliar code:

```
"Explain what this regex does: ^[a-zA-Z0-9+_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$"
"Walk me through this algorithm"
"What does this SQL query do?"
```

### Documentation

Generate docs for your code:

```
"Add JSDoc comments to this function"
"Write a README for this project"
"Document this API endpoint"
```

## Chat Interface

### Messages

- **You** - Your messages appear on the right
- **AI** - Responses appear on the left with syntax highlighting

### Code Blocks

AI responses include syntax-highlighted code blocks. Tap to:

- **Copy** - Copy code to clipboard
- **Insert** - Insert into current file
- **Run** - Execute in terminal (if appropriate)

### Conversation History

Previous conversations are saved per Space. Access them by:

1. Tap the history icon in chat
2. Select a previous conversation
3. Continue where you left off

## Tips

### Be Specific

More detail = better answers:

```
❌ "Fix my code"
✅ "My React useEffect runs infinitely. Here's my component: [code]. How do I fix the dependency array?"
```

### Share Context

Include relevant files or errors:

```
"Looking at src/utils/parser.js, can you optimize the parse function?"
```

### Follow Up

Continue the conversation to refine answers:

```
"That works, but can you make it handle null values?"
```
