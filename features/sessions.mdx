## Overview

Sessions are how you work on projects in Kisuke. Each session is tied to a project and preserves your chat history with Claude, terminal tabs, and browsing tabs across all your devices.

## Creating a Session

1. Open Kisuke
2. Tap **Sessions** in the bottom navigation
3. Tap **+ New Session**
4. Choose a project name and location

## Session Types

### Local Session

A session on your mobile device:

- Files stored locally
- Works offline
- Limited by device storage

### Connected Session

A session on a connected computer or server:

- Files on remote machine
- Requires active connection
- Access your full development environment

## Working with Sessions

### Switching Sessions

Tap the session name at the top of the screen to switch between sessions.

### Session Contents

Each session contains:

- **Chat** - Your full conversation history with Claude, preserved across devices
- **Terminal** - Shell tabs that persist and sync between devices
- **Browser** - Browsing tabs remembered across all your devices
- **Files** - Project files and folders

### Project Detection

Kisuke automatically detects project types:

- Node.js (package.json)
- Python (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- Rust (Cargo.toml)
- Go (go.mod)
- And more...

## AI Context

When you chat with Claude in a session, it has context about:

- Your project structure
- Recent file changes
- Terminal history
- Previous conversations

This helps Claude give more relevant suggestions.

## Syncing

Sessions sync automatically across all your devices:

- Chat history is preserved everywhere
- Terminal tabs persist across devices
- Browsing tabs are remembered
- File changes appear immediately

## Best Practices

### One Session Per Project

Keep things organized by creating a separate session for each project you're working on.

### Use Connected Sessions for Heavy Work

For large projects or resource-intensive tasks, use connected sessions on your computer.

### Local Sessions for Quick Edits

Local sessions are great for quick scripts, notes, or experimenting.
